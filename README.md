# Social listening using Twitter & LinkedIn 👨🏽‍💻
### The main purpose of this project is to know what is the perpective that the public have of certain companies, in this case, bank entities.

#### LinkedIn
I decided to use LinkedIn as a source because of the following ideas:
* Why would somebody follow a company in LinkedIn? Well because he consider it as a interesting, good and attractive company.
* The more followers, the better is the perspective.

#### Twitter
Well, Twitter couldn't just not be forgotten, here is the place where a lot of people like to share their opinions.
I want to use everything that could be useful:
* Hashtags.
* Emojis.
* Tweets.

In order to analyze tweets, I'll use sentimental analysis with Textblob library for python.

Cheers! 🙌
